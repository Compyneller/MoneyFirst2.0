      </p>

      <h5 style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}>6. Conduct of customers/users</h5>
      <h5>6.1</h5>
      <p>
        Payment becomes due at the time that you submit your Transaction. You
        authorize Moneyfirst to charge your Payment Account for the Money
        Transfer Funds. You understand and acknowledge that Moneyfirst has no
        obligation to process or complete a Transaction if Moneyfirst is unable
        for any reason to obtain authorization or settlement of the funds from
        charging your Payment Account.
      </p>
      <h5>6.2</h5>
      <p>
        In the event, that the charge to your Payment Account is subsequently
        returned, charged back, or canceled for any reason, and Moneyfirst has
        already processed your Transaction, you will be responsible to
        Moneyfirst for the amount. In such an event, we reserve the right to
        mark the lien on the Beneficiary/Receiver account where such funds were
        credited and continue the lien until such time the funds are returned.
        You agree to pay such amount, plus any applicable service fee or
        insufficient funds fee applicable to the return, to Moneyfirst
        immediately upon demand.
      </p>
      <h5>6.3</h5>
      <p>
        You will provide true, accurate, current and complete information
        regarding the Beneficiary/Receiver for all Transactions.
      </p>
      <h5>6.4</h5>
      <p>
        We do not accept any liability for damages resulting from non-payment or
        delay in payment of an INR(D) transfer to a Beneficiary/Receiver or
        failure to perform a transaction under the Service.
      </p>
      <h5>6.5</h5>
      <p>
        When you pay for a Transaction in one currency and the Receiver is paid
        in another currency, there will be a difference between the exchange
        rate at which we buy foreign currency and the exchange rate provided to
        you. We and our Service Providers may have a profit or loss in these
        circumstances because the rate at which we or our Service Providers
        obtain foreign currency may not be the same as the exchange rate
        provided to you. If a Receiver's account is denominated in another
        currency, there may be delays, additional charges, or different exchange
        rates. Please ensure the currency requested for the transaction is the
        same as the currency of the account where the funds are to be delivered.
        If additional charges are incurred due to incorrect information provided
        by you, the amount received by the Receiver will be reduced by the
        amount of such additional charges.
      </p>
      <h5>6.6</h5>
      <p>
        It is your responsibility to ensure all transaction details are accurate
        before submission of the Transaction. You will be allowed to review the
        transaction details before submission of the Transaction for processing.
        Once a Transaction has been submitted for processing it is not normally
        possible to change the details.
      </p>
      <h5>6.7</h5>
      <p>
        We are not responsible for any fees or charges you may incur when
        utilizing a particular Payment Instrument to send INR(D) Worldwide or
        receiving funds in your Moneyfirst wallet. These may include but are not
        limited to unauthorized overdraft fees imposed by banks if there are
        insufficient funds in your bank account or "cash advance" fees,
        credit/debit card charges, and additional interest which may be imposed
        by your bank if they treat the Service as a credit transaction rather
        than a cash transaction.
      </p>
      <h5>6.8</h5>
      <p>
        You will use the Service only to send funds to people that you know
        personally and not to pay for any goods or services. If in breach of
        this clause, you choose to pay third parties for goods and services
        using the Service, you acknowledge that we have no control over, and are
        not responsible for, the quality, safety, legality, or delivery of such
        goods or services and that any such use of the Service is entirely at
        your own risk. If we reasonably believe you are using the Service to
        purchase goods or services, we reserve the right to cancel your
        transaction(s).
      </p>
      <h5>6.9</h5>
      <p>
        Both Customer and Receiver will act on behalf of their respective
        selves. You may not submit or receive a Transaction on behalf of a third
        party. If you intend to submit or receive a Transaction on behalf of a
        company, business, or a third party individual, you must first inform us
        of your desire to do so and provide us with such additional information
        as deemed fit about the company, business or third party individual, so
        that we may decide whether to permit the transaction or not.
      </p>
      <h5>6.10</h5>
      <p>
        In using the Service you will comply with these Terms and Conditions as
        well as any applicable laws, rules, or regulations. You will not use the
        Service to send money:
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>● 6.10.1</strong> to a recipient who has violated the Terms and
        Conditions, or
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>● 6.10.2</strong> in connection with illegal activity including
        without limitation money laundering, fraud, and the funding of terrorist
        organizations.
      </p>
      <h5>6.11</h5>
      <p>
        If you use the Service in connection with illegal activity or any
        activity which seems suspicious, we will report your Transaction(s) to
        the appropriate legal authorities.
      </p>
      <h5>6.12</h5>
      <p>
        We may, as is necessary to provide the Service, store all information
        required of a Receiver to prove his or her identity or associated with
        the Receiver's specific Transaction. Such proofs may include, but are
        not limited to, a suitable form of valid, unexpired identification from
        a list of acceptable documents provided by the Service Provider, and/or
        a transaction tracking number, a personal identification number (PIN), a
        "password," a "secret word" or other similar identifiers as we or our
        Service Provider may deem fit.
      </p>
      <h5>6.13</h5>
      <p>
        In case we do not receive the Transaction Amount and fee/charges, and
        the Transaction Amount is credited/paid out to the Beneficiary/Receiver,
        Moneyfirst shall have the right to recover the Transaction Amount along
        with all associated charges from the Customer. By initiating a
        Transaction on the Application, you are aware and agree that the INR(D)
        may be credited to the account of the Beneficiary before receipt of
        funds from you by Moneyfirst. In such an event, we reserve the right to
        mark the lien on the Beneficiary/Receiver account where such funds were
        credited and continue the lien until such time the funds are returned.
        You further agree that a mere demand from Moneyfirst in such
        circumstances shall be a good reason for you to pay the shortfall/loss
        without any demur or delay.
      </p>
      <h5>6.14</h5>
      <p>
        The Service Provider may credit/payout the Transaction Amount only after
        it has received a confirmation that funds have been received in its bank
        account. If it comes to the notice of Moneyfirst that you had
        insufficient funds in the Payment Account from which you requested the
        Transaction or you have provided wrong details of the designated bank
        account, the Service Provider may cancel the Transaction and you shall
        bear full liability and responsibility for the same. In the event the
        insufficiency of funds is learned by Moneyfirst after the Recipient has
        received the Transaction Amount, you will be liable to reimburse
        Moneyfirst (as applicable) of the amount remitted and any other charges
        and costs incurred by Moneyfirst and/or the Service Provider. You agree
        to pay such an amount immediately upon Moneyfirst demand. Moneyfirst
        shall also be entitled to inform any credit bureau or any other person
        or entity including the law enforcement agencies if you fail to
        pay/reimburse such amount or any part thereof.
      </p>

      </p>
      <h5>7.2</h5>
      <p>

        on your behalf. We may, in our sole discretion, choose whether or not to
        accept the offer to process that Transaction. However, if we decide not
        to process the Transaction, we will notify you promptly of that decision
        and repay the money paid to us.
      </p>
      <h5>7.3</h5>
